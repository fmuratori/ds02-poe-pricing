APPLICATION

########################################################

PROJECT
    PERSONAL GOALS
        The following gloals are not ordered by importance:
        - improve python programming
        - improve git usage
        - study ML and DL algorithms
        - improve project management
        - improve project engineering 
        - do something useful

    USE CASE, REASONS AND PROJECT GOALS
        - poe economy is quiet hard to master, assistance tools may be a wonderful option for unskilled players
        - ideally a system is implemented to allow users to define a good and fair price for acquired items during gameplay
        - the system must be easy to use and most importantly provide useful data
        - would be great if the system implemented could easy adapt to gameplay changes such as new in game seasons or mechanics
